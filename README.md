## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Simple-template
```

### 2) Open in browser

You can run it directly without any build step:

- Double-click `index.html`, or
- Use a local server (recommended):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

## 🛠️ Customization

- Update text content in the HTML files
- Replace images in the `images/` folder
- Adjust styles in `assets/css/main.css`
- Fix/rename page files if needed (e.g., `Conect Us.html` → `Contact Us.html`)

## 📌 Notes

- The contact form currently uses `action="#"` and does not submit to a real backend.
- This is a static project with no JavaScript build tooling required.
